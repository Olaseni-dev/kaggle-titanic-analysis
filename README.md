# Titanic Analysis

This project contains data analysis and machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Machine learning model training and evaluation

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Olaseni-dev/titanic-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage

Open the `titanic_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
Run the cells to see the analysis and model results.
